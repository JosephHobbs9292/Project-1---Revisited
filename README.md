## Top Three Features for Linear Regression Model for Determining Price
---
1. Outlet Type is the most important feature if the outlet type = grocery store it has a -1500 impact on the outlet sales.
2. Outlet Size is the second most important feature, those with a High size receiving 500+ to their total sales.
3. Item Visibility is the third most important feature with a negative coefficient of of almost 500.

## Top Three Features for Determing Sales Total with a Random Forest Model
---
1. Item MRP accounted for roughly 40% of the total sales determination. 
2. Outlet Type = grocery store accounted slightly more than 20% of the final total sales.
3. Item visibility accounted for slightly more than 10% of the final total sales.

Feature Importance Bar Graph:

Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3
Outlet_Size_High
Item_Type_seafood
Permutation Importance Bar Graph:

Item_MRP
Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3
Outlet Type Grocery Store
The two graphs identified different features as being importance, the only feature they have in common being Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3 though in different positions of importance.

## Permutation Bar Graph Analysis
---

1. Item MRP - When Item MRP is of a higher value the overall sales of the store also increases. 
2. Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3 -When this feature has a higher value sales increase.
3. Outlet Type Grocery Store - When the grocery store is type 3 the
